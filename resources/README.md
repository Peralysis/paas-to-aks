**# Place all (Sitecore) license files and certificates in this folder**

*Note that if you run the Identity signing certificate and TLS HTTPS certificates scripts from the ./scripts folder, the output will be placed in here automatically, and you only need to provide your own license.xml file to be able to run the compress-license-file.ps1 script.*
